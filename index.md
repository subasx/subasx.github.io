### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, Lab 2 was very important for me, it was the first lab of my computer science class. Having no prior experience, it was challenging for me to understand the concepts in the beginning. With the help of my partner, I was able to understand and learn the fundamentals of it and I enjoyed that a lot in the end. 

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was very difficult for me. Lab 3 was about the pizza diameters and slices. Even though I didn't really understand how to work on it, with teachers' support throughout the lab I was able to understand the problem. This lab taught me how our daily usage we can use computer science to understand it and that was really fun to learn. Overall, the lab was great because we learned the basic functions and materials we were soon going to learn in the future.
  
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, I enjoyed implementing data difference. I found it fascinating to work in this lab because I was able to calculate the date differences in the end of the lab. I learned a bunch of handling dates and got the taste of quirks of C++. Furthermore, I was able to get to know my partners and it was very fun working together and learning.
