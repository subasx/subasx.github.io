### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 2, Lab 2 was very imporatn for me, it was my first lab of my computer scinece class. Having no prior experince it was challenging for me to understand the concepts in the beginning. With the help of my parther I was able to understand and learn the fundamental of it and I enjoyed that alot in the end.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was very difficult for me. The lab 3 was about the pizza diameters and slices. Even though I didn't really understand how to work on it, with teachers support thoughout the lab I was able to understand the problem. This lab taught me how our daily useage we can use computer science to understand it and that was really fun to learn. Overall, the lab was great becaseu we learned the baisc functions and materials we were soon going to learn in future. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, I enjoyed implementing data differece. I found it fascinating to work in this lab beucase I was ableto to calculate the date diffencees in the end of the lab. I learned bunch of handling dates and got the taste of quirks of C++.
